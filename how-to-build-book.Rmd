## Julie's workflow from RStudio

Based on <https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html>

First install `jupyter-book` in Bash from the Command Line (I use Terminal from within RStudio)
```{bash}
pip install -U jupyter-book
```

Next, clone the repository and set it as the current directory. I did this from RStudio 
```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/openscapes_jupyterbook_test/
cd openscapes_jupyterbook_test
```

```{bash}
jupyter-book build ./book
```
