## Julie's workflow from RStudio

Based on <https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html>. This is all in Bash from the Command Line (I use Terminal from within RStudio), no Python needed. 

First install `jupyter-book`:
```{bash}
pip install -U jupyter-book
```

Next, clone the repository and set it as the current directory (I did this clicking from RStudio)
```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/openscapes_jupyterbook_test/
cd openscapes_jupyterbook_test
```

Then, build the book!
```{bash}
jupyter-book build ./book
```

When Cole added updates, I merged his pull request at GitHub.com and then: 
```{bash}
git pull
jupyter-book build ./book
```
